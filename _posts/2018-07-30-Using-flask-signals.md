Learning how to send signals via flask:

but let define what is a signals

## Defintion 

We can find many definition of signals and event in the net but this is my prefered from [django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signals/)

*Django includes a “signal dispatcher” which helps allow decoupled applications get notified when actions occur elsewhere in the framework. 
In a nutshell, signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. 
They’re especially useful when many pieces of code may be in  the same events.*
