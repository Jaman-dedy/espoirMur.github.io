Most of the time want to cnnect via ssh to a remote laptop from my mac I get this error:


```
ssh root@10.**.**.**
root@10.**.**.**'s password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
```

I'm trying to figure out what is the problem.

to debug I usually do :

```
ssh -v root@10.**.**.**
```

And mostly I found that it's a problem of certificate public certificates

How to solve it ???

once of the best soluction is to find a way to login to the machine without ssh
you can use either putty on wiindows or the host dashboard(eg: DigitalOcean if the remote machine is hosted at digitalocean )
and edit this file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
you can either use nano or any other text editor
inside the file try to find the following line:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

and  replace the no with yes.
close and restart the machine 
then you can logged in the computer via ssh.
