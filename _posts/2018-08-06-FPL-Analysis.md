With 4 days to go for FPL season and after more than 20 changes from my initial squad let me analyze my team.

## GoalKeepers:

**Fabiansky (Liverpool)**: I should expect some saves from him for the first game and check how He will perform for the next 3 fixtures

**Leno(Keep Him on the bench )**: Arsenal looks like they will concede against man city but should have more good fixtures to come.
A good history from Leverkusen.

## Defenders: 

**Mendy**: (Has a good form and has already recovered from last season injury ) I can expect assists form him and some clean sheets.

**Roberson**: Average of 5 points per match last season, a Guaranteed starter from Kloop So Can expect assists and Goals.
But For the coming days, I can swap him for Trippier or Clyne or Alexender-Arnold.

**van Aanholt**: Good last season and has also a good pre-season should expect some goals and assist from him:
But should keep an eye on Coleman from Everton or Baines.

**Cédric**: He is a bargain for 4.5£ I could get some points from him.

**Wan-Bissaka**: To complete my squad, he starts in most of Crystal palace friendlies games until I find others options for 4£
