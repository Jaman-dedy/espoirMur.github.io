## GoalKeepers:

**Fabiansky (Liverpool)** : I should expected save from him for the first game and check how He will perform for the next 3 fixtures

**Leno(Keep Him on bench )**: Arsenal look like they will conceded against man city but should have more good fixtures to came.
Good history from leverkusen.

## Defenders: 

**Mendy**: (Has a good form and has already recovered from last season injury ) I can expect assist for him and some cleansheets.

**Roberson** : Average of 5 points per match last season , Guaranted starter from Kloop So Can expect assist and Goals.
But For the comming days I can swap him for trippier.

**van Aanholt** : Good last season and has also a good pre-season should expect some goals and assist from him:
But sould keep an eye on Coleman from everton or Baines..

**Cédric** : He is a bargain for 4.5£ I could get some points from him .

**Wan-Bissaka** : To complete my list , he start in most of Crystal palace friendlies games until I find others options for 4£
