## Test Driven development 

I'm writing this post to summarize what I'm learning about TDD

Test driven development or TDD is a style of programming which refer to the practice of writing unit test before writing code.

For the first time the test should fail, and after failing you write simple code to make the code pass, and refrector it to make 
it work as you want.

Developers know the cycle as _red , green , refractor_.

As said by __Rudyard Kipling__ following the story [http://members.optusnet.com.au/charles57/Creative/Techniques/elephants_child.htm](*__"Elephant's Child"__* in *__"Just So Stories"__*)

> I keep six honest serving-men
> (They taught me all I knew);
> Their names are *What* and *Why* and *When*
> And *How* and *Where* and *Who*.

So everytime We are studying something new, We should always answer those 6 questions.

So let Go

## Who 

### Who create TDD ?

Everytime you are reading about TDD, you should came acrros this name : *Kent Beck*

Here is what is said in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck](his wikipedia):

> Kent Beck (born 1961) is an American software engineer and the creator of extreme programming,
> a software development methodology that eschews rigid formal specification for a collaborative and iterative design process.
> Beck was one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto,
> the founding document for agile software development. 
> *__Extreme and Agile methods are closely associated with Test-Driven Development (TDD)__*, 
> of which Beck is perhaps the leading proponent.
