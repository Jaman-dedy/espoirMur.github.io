The first step is to install developer tools on the new laptop wihout installing Xcode (it's very large cannot afford to download it)

- Open the terminal
type the following one and follow the prompt :

```
xcode-select --install
```

follow [this link](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/) for a precise step by step guide .

The second step is to get rid of the default mac terminal  and install a powerfull and customizable terminal;
my choice is [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

let install it we need curl :

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
and now let customize it to make it a beautifull terminal !
